# 1st Project - Big Mart Sales Prediction
## Introduction:

Grocery store chain wants to predict sales for their outlets.
The Benefits of predicting sales include understanding which products to promote.

### Machine Learning Concepts:
Regression: Predicting a continuous value based on features.
Supervised learning: Training a model with labeled data (target variable included).

### Data Processing and Analysis:
Data is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Missing values are handled by imputation (using mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features).
Data analysis involves descriptive statistics, distribution plots, and count plots.

### Feature Engineering:
Categorical features are encoded into numerical values using label encoding.
The Target variable (sales) is separated from features.
Data is split into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
XGBoost Regressor model is trained on the training data.
The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score on both the training and testing sets.
A good R-squared value indicates that the model is performing well in predicting sales.

# 2nd Project - Sales Forecasting

This project provides a structured step-by-step approach to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building for a sales prediction problem. 
The main goal is to predict sales for specific products in specific stores using various attributes and data manipulation techniques.

1. Data Preparation:
Load and explore the data.
Handle missing data by filling in null values based on domain knowledge and statistical methods.
Identify high-cardinality categorical features and create higher-level item-type features.

2. Feature Engineering:
Create reusable functions for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Use feature hashing to reduce the dimensionality of categorical features (e.g., item IDs).
Derive new features from existing ones using logical or mathematical operations.

3. Model Selection and Evaluation:
Train and evaluate multiple models, such as random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting.
Use cross-validation to estimate model performance on the training data.
Select the model with the best performance metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).

4. Final Model Deployment:
Use the selected model for data transformation and prediction on test or live data.
Deploy the model in a suitable production environment (e.g., using an API).

### Additional Insights:
* It is important to understand the domain knowledge of the problem to make informed decisions during data preprocessing and feature engineering.
* Splitting the data into training and test sets helps prevent data leakage and ensures unbiased model evaluation.
* One-hot encoding can lead to a high number of features, which can be addressed using techniques like feature hashing or label encoding.
* Data transformations, such as log or square root, can be applied to handle skewed data.
* Regular model retraining is necessary to incorporate new data and maintain model accuracy.
